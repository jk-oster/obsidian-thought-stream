# Credits

First and foremost, big thanks to the creators of [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) for creating
such an AWESOME and FREE note-taking tool.

This plugin is based on a fork of the [Whisper Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/nikdanilov/whisper-obsidian-plugin). 
So special thanks to the creator of [Whisper Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/nikdanilov/whisper-obsidian-plugin) 
[@Nik Danilov](https://github.com/nikdanilov) for his awesome work. Furthermore, thanks to the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin by
[@SilentVoid13](https://github.com/SilentVoid13) which served as an example on how to solve certain problems by using the plugin API. 

Their efforts make this plugin possible.
