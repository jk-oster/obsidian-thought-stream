Obsidian Thought Stream is a plugin that effortlessly turns your speech into written notes. 
Speak your mind, and let [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) from OpenAI do the rest!

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. This plugin can be installed from "Community Plugins" inside Obsidian or via the [BRAT Plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian42-brat).
2. For this plugin to work, you will need to provide your OpenAI API key (or an OpenAI compatible API + key).

## üéØ How to Use

### Access Recording RecorderModal

Click on the ribbon button to open the recording controls interface.

### Record Audio

Use the "Start" button to begin recording. You can pause and resume the recording using the "Pause/Resume" button. Click the "Stop" button once you're done. After stopping the recording, the plugin will automatically transcribe the audio and create a new note with the transcribed content and linked audio file in the specified folder.

> You can quickly start or stop recording using the `Alt + Q` shortcut.

### Upload Existing Audio File

You can also transcribe an existing audio file:

-   Open the command palette with `Ctrl/Cmd + P`.
-   Search for "Upload Audio File" and select it.
-   A file dialog will appear. Choose the audio file you want to transcribe.
-   The plugin will transcribe the selected file and create a new note with the content and linked audio file in the specified folder.

### Command Palette for Quick Actions

Both "Start/Stop recording" and "Upload Audio File" actions can also be accessed quickly through the command palette.
